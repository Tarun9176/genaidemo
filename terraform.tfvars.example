# Terraform Variables Example File
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize the values for your environment
# This file demonstrates how to provide values for the required variables

# Environment Configuration
# Specify the target environment (must be: dev, staging, or prod)
environment = "dev"

# AWS Region Configuration
# AWS region where resources will be deployed
aws_region = "us-west-2"

# ECS Cluster Configuration
# Name for your ECS cluster (will be used as prefix for related resources)
cluster_name = "my-web-app"

# Network Configuration
# IMPORTANT: Replace these with your actual VPC and subnet IDs
# VPC ID where ECS resources will be created
vpc_id = "vpc-12345678"

# List of subnet IDs across multiple AZs for high availability
# Recommend using private subnets with NAT gateway for production
subnet_ids = [
  "subnet-12345678",  # AZ 1
  "subnet-87654321"   # AZ 2
]

# Container Configuration
# Docker image to deploy (can be from ECR, Docker Hub, etc.)
container_image = "nginx:latest"

# Port that your application listens on inside the container
container_port = 80

# Resource Allocation
# CPU and memory allocation for ECS tasks
# Valid CPU/Memory combinations for Fargate:
# CPU: 256, Memory: 512, 1024, 2048
# CPU: 512, Memory: 1024-4096 (in 1GB increments)
# CPU: 1024, Memory: 2048-8192 (in 1GB increments)
task_cpu    = 256   # 0.25 vCPU
task_memory = 512   # 512 MB

# Scaling Configuration
# Number of task instances to run simultaneously
desired_count = 2   # Minimum 2 for high availability

# Sensitive Data (store in separate .tfvars file or use environment variables)
# Database credentials
db_username = "admin"
db_password = "<your-secure-password>"

# API credentials
api_key = "<your-api-key>"
